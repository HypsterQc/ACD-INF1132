# INF1132 // Mathematics for Computer Science

In the INF1132 course, I explore essential mathematical concepts for computer science, such as logic, set theory, relations, functions, and graphs. I also learn to analyze algorithm complexity and use techniques like induction and recursion. These concepts help me better understand the design of algorithms and data structures. This course is based on the textbook *Discrete Mathematics* by Kenneth H. Rosen.
